# Overview

I want to create a web framework that will make it easy to put in a list of items and then choose between those items two at a time until the program has enough information to give me a list of most liked to least liked.

# Development Environment

I'm working with the Yew web framework for Rust.

Development is done in IntelliJ

# Useful Websites

* [Yew Documentation](https://yew.rs/)
* [Yew Crash Course Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmLiMozWNGA)
* [Article: Basic Interactions with Yew](https://dev.to/fllstck/basic-interactions-with-yew-3pa3)

# Future Work

* Refresh myself on sorting algorithms and how they could work in a step by step fashion with user input
* Actually get the program working and sorting
* Add an output item where the list will be displayed after sorting
* Add an input box to import any list desired
